## TODO (March 21st 2025)
- duplicate relics (hourglass & gilded) do not change the currency weights to lower values on floor 3 & 4
  - E.g. Exalt on last slot on floor 3 is worth zero
  - E.g. Exalt on middle slot on floor 4 is worth zero
- divinity/chalice has some odd edge cases that need to be fixed
  - e.g. need to open the sanctum map menu for it to understand what room you're in so it updates that there is in face no more pact rooms remaining, take the money
  - Can't really fix them without cleaning up the code
