## Dev Notes (Goals the last time I worked on it)
- Setup "Special" Settings section for weights
  - Connections
  - Empty/Unknown Room
  - Unknown Affliction Room (Unhandled due to not knowing)
  - Coin Low / Coin High
  - Resolve Low / Resolve High
  - etc.

- Setup "No Boon" Relic settings section for weights
